## Setting up git & github: 
- Create ssh keys: ``shh-keygen [-t ed25519] file_name``
- Add generated public key (.pub extension) to your github account (see your profile settings)
- Add private key (you need that for deciphering messages sent to you) to your machine: ``???``
- Clone desired repo: ``git clone "SSH_link_from_github"``
